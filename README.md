## Description

## Setup/Installation Requirements


_This application asks the user to enter an integer and counts up to that number._
_Counting to the entered integer follows three rules:_
* _Integers divisible by 3 are replaced by ping_
* _divisible by 5 are replaced by pong_*  
* _integers divisible by 3 and 5 are replaced by Ping-pong_

## Specifications:

_Take a number as input and display it in the results section of the page_
* _I: 22_
* _O: 22_

_Take a number as input and convert it to an array of the same length:_
* _I: 5_
* _O: [1,2,3,4,5]_

_Check if each value is divisible by 3 and return ping if True_
* _I:5_
* _o:[1,2,ping,4,5]_

_Check if each value is divisible by 5 and return pong if True_
* _I:5_
* _o:[1,2,3,4,pong]_

_Check if each number is divisible by 3 or 5, print ping and pong respectively_
* _I:5_
* _o:[1,2,pong,4,pong]_

_Check if each number of the array is divisible by both 3 and 5 and output ping-pong at that index_
* _I:15_
* _o:[1,2,ping,4,pong,ping,7,8,ping, pong,11,ping,13,14,Ping-pong];_
